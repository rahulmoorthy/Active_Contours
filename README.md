# Active_Contours

• Traditional method involved using Active Contours Model (Snakes by Kass). It used internal and external energy functions to find a boundary surrounding the object in focus. 

• This methodology was used to detect anomalies in brain scans, teeth scans.

• Leveraged MATLAB, initialized the control points and the model shaped the snake-like closed form (solving internal & external functions) to create the boundary on the object.
